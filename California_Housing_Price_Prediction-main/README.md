# California_Housing_Price_Prediction
Worked with Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and models viz. LinearRegressior, DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor. Used California Housing Dataset available on Kaggle to provide useful insights about the market price of land present in different landscape based of factors like median_income of household, distance form coastal region, population per household and various other factors. Performed beautiful visualization for better understanding of clients.
Achieved an RMSE score of 47227.48 using RandomForestRegressor.
